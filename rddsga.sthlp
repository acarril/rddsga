{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:rddsga} allows to conduct a binary subgroup analysis in RDD settings based on inverse propensity score weights (IPSW).
Observations in each subgroup are weighted by the inverse of their conditional probabilities to belong to that subgroup, given a set of covariates.
Analyzing the differential treatment effect in the reweighted sample helps isolating the difference due to the subgroup characteristic of interest from other observable dimensions.

{pstd}
{cmd:rddsga} computes IPSW based on the vector of covariates in {it:indepvars}, which are also used as control variables in the model.
A separate set of variables to compute IPSW may be optionally specified with {opt balance(varlist)}.
A new variable with IPSW may be generated using {opt psweight(newvar)}.
In order to assess the statistical significance of the difference in means for each covariate, {cmd:rddsga} uses a t-test on the equality of means and reports the resulting p-value, as well as the (weighted) standardized mean difference.
Joint significance is assessed using an F-test.
The resulting balance tables are stored as matrices (see {help rddsga##results:stored results} below), and may also be displayed using {opt dibalance}.

{pstd}
Options {opt firststage}, {opt reducedform} and {opt ivregress} may be used to estimate the first stage, reduced form and treatment effects using OLS and IV methods, respectively.
Standard variance estimator options may be used for these estimators with {opt vce(vcetype)}.
The estimated coefficients for the interaction of indicator variables for each subgroup and a treatment indicator are reported, along with bootstrap standard errors (unless other {it:vcetype} is specified).

{pstd}
Additional details regarding the methodology implemented by {cmd: rddsga} can be found in the project's {browse "https://gitlab.com/acarril/rddsga/wikis/home":repository}.
An application can be found in {help rddsga##mainpaper:Gerardino, Litschig, Olken and Pomeranz (2017)}.


{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}

{dlgtab:RD design}

{phang}
{opt sgroup(varname)} specifies a subgroup indicator variable.
This variable must be a {it:dummy} (values 0 or 1).
This option must be specified.

{phang}
{opt treatment(varname)} specifies an indicator variable for actual treatment status.
If not specified, a sharp RDD is assumed.

{phang}
{opt cutoff(real)} specifies the cutoff value in {it:assignvar}; default is 0 (assuming normalized {it:assignvar}).

{phang}
{opt bwidth(real)} specifies a symmetrical the bandwidth around the cutoff.
This option must be specified.

{dlgtab:Balance}

{phang}
{opt balance(varlist)} specifies the variables that enter the propensity score estimation.
If not specified, variables in {it:indepvars} are used.
This option is useful if one wants to balance a different set of covariates than the ones used as controls in the model.
This option must be specified if {it:indepvars} is empty.

{phang}
{opt probit} indicates that the propensity score is computed after a fitting a  {manhelp probit R:probit} model; default is {manhelp logit R:logit}.

{phang}
{opt nocomsup} indicates that the sample is not to be restricted to the area of common support.

{marker options_model}{...}
{dlgtab:Model}

{phang}
{opt firststage} estimates the discontinuity in the treatment probability using OLS.

{phang}
{opt reducedform} estimates the reduced form effect using OLS.

{phang}
{opt ivregress} estimates the treatment effect using instrumental variable regression.
If specified, it requires that a treatment variable is also specified in {opt treatment(varname)}.
See {help ivregress} for additional information.

{phang}
{opt quadratic} indicates that a quadratic spline is to be used for full interaction with subgroup indicators. If not specified, a linear spline is used.

{phang}
{opt vce(vcetype)} specifies the variance estimators options.
{it:vcetype} may be unadjusted, robust, cluster clustvar, bootstrap, jackknife, or hac kernel (see {help  vce_option}).
Bootstrap is used by default, unless {opt nobootstrap} is used (see below), or a different {it:vcetype} is specified.

{pmore}
{cmd:rddsga} computes the bootstrap estimate of the variance-covariance matrix by taking a random sample (with replacement) of size {it:N} from the observations and computing the estimate as usual.
This process is repeated the number of times specied in {opt bsreps(#)} (see below), which yields a bootstrap distribution of estimates.
See {it:Methods and formulas} in {manlink R bootstrap} for further details.

{pmore}
Confidence intervals and p-values are estimated using the percentile method by default. See the {opt normal} option below for further details and other options.

{phang}
{opt bsreps(#)} perform # bootstrap replications; default is {opt bsreps(50)}.

{phang}
{opt normal} computes and report normal-based p-values and confidence intervals.
By default {cmd:rddsga} uses the so-called percentile method, which means we compute the empirical p-value, i.e. the proportion of bootstrap estimates further in the tails than the (absolute value of the) original estimate.
The percentile method yields nonparametric confidence intervals that correspond to the {it:p}th quantile of the bootstrap distribution.
See {it:Methods and formulas} in {manlink R bootstrap} for further details.

{pmore}
If {opt normal} is specified, p-values are obtained using the normality assumption, which yields confidence intervals that correspond to the {it:p}th quantile of the standard normal distribution.

{phang}
{opt nobootstrap} prevents computing bootstrap standard errors, which is the default.

{phang}
{opt noipsw} prevents employing inverse propensity score weighting for the estimations.

{marker options_reporting}{...}
{dlgtab:Reporting}

{phang}
{opt dibalance} display original balance and propensity score weighting balance tables and statistics.
This balance is computed for each covariate in {it:indepvars}, unless {opt balance(varlist)} is specified.

{phang}
{opt psweight(newvar)} specifies a name for a new variable with the propensity score weighting. If not specified, no variable will be generated.

{phang}
{opt comsup(newvar)} specifies a name for a new binary variable indicating common support. If not specified, no variable will be generated.

{phang}
{opt pscore(newvar)} specifies a name for a new variable with the propensity score. If not specified, no variable will be generated.
